I’m an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Sociology at the University of Washington.

My work focuses on implementing AI-driven interactive systems that make technology more accessible, transparent, and human-centered. I combine Human-Computer Interaction research with full-stack engineering to turn design concepts into scalable software systems that translate research into real-world impact.

I’ve worked at [UW’s ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/) on AI-powered accessibility and interaction systems, at [Tsinghua’s INSC](https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn/) on privacy-aware AI systems, and interned at Siemens Digital Industries, focusing on market strategy for predictive maintenance and how AI-driven technologies create value in industrial contexts.

I aim to bridge technical innovation and human-centered thinking to build technologies that earn trust and create equitable impact.
